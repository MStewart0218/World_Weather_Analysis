# World_Weather_Analysis
API call with the OpenWeatherMap analysis

> ## Overview of Project:
> Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Retrieve the current weather description for each city. 
> Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
> Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
